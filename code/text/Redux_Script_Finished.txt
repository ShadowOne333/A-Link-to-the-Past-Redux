[Name], I'm going out for a[2]while.  I'll be back by morning.[3]Don't leave the house.
Unnh... That voice... [Name]?[2]Is it you?  I told you[3]to wait at home...[Waitkey][Scroll]Take my sword and shield and[Scroll]listen.  You can focus power in[Scroll]the blade (hold the [B] Button).[Waitkey][Scroll]...Then release it using the[Scroll]secret technique handed down[Scroll]by our people...[Waitkey][Scroll][Name]... you must rescue[Scroll]Princess Zelda. Our people are[Scroll]fated to do so.[Waitkey][Scroll]But do not fall victim...[Scroll]to fate... [Name]...[Waitkey][Scroll]I shall always remember...[Scroll]our time... together...
What're you doing up this late,[2]kid?  You can stay up when[3]you're grown up!  Now go home!
I see you brought a map so you[2]don't get lost.  (Press the[3][X] Button to see your map).
You look strong for a kid.  How[2]much can you lift?  (Press the[3][A] Button while touching a thing[Waitkey][Scroll]to lift it.)
I'll bet you can't wait until you[2]are old enough to use a sword![3](Press the [B] Button to use[Waitkey][Scroll]your sword when you get it.)
That mark on your map must be[2]your destination.
You can often find valuables[2]in chests.  (Press the [A][3]Button in front of a chest to[Waitkey][Scroll]open it.)
Us soldiers have been around,[2]kid.  You can learn a lot from[3]us.  But you already know that!
Meet the elder of the village[2]and get the Master Sword.
Princess Zelda, you are safe![2]Is this your doing, [Name]?
I sense that a mighty evil[2]force guides the priest's[3]actions and augments his[Waitkey][Scroll]magical power.  The only[Scroll]weapon potent enough to[Scroll]defeat the priest is the[Waitkey][Scroll]legendary Master Sword.[Scroll]It is said that the village elder[Scroll]is a descendant of one of the[Waitkey][Scroll]seven sages.  Maybe[Scroll]he can tell you more...[Scroll]I will mark his house on your[Waitkey][Scroll]map.  But watch your every[Scroll]move!  I am certain that the[Scroll]castle soldiers will be looking[Waitkey][Scroll]for you now!  ...    ...    ...[Sound 2D][Scroll]I will hide Princess Zelda here.[Scroll]Do not worry!  Seek the elder![Waitkey][Scroll]...    ...    ...[Scroll]Do you understand?[Scroll]    > Yes[Scroll]       Not at all[Choose]
If you defeat the priest, the[2]soldiers may regain[3]their sanity.[Waitkey][Scroll]Go, seek the Pendants!
Take the three Pendants into[2]the Lost Woods.  The Master[3]Sword awaits you there.
[Name]!  You are a second too[2]late.  I have failed... Zelda...[3]The soldiers have[Waitkey][Scroll]abducted her.[Scroll]They have taken her to[Scroll]the castle.[Waitkey][Scroll]You must find her before the[Scroll]priest works his magic.[Waitkey][Scroll]Please...You are our only[Scroll]hope...
Thank you, [Name].  I had a[2]feeling you were getting close.
Yes, it was [Name] who helped[2]me escape from the dungeon![3]When I was captive the priest[Waitkey][Scroll]said, "Once I have finished with[Scroll]you, the final one, the seal of[Scroll]the sages will open."[Waitkey][Scroll]...    ...    ...[Scroll][Name], you must not let the[Scroll]land of Hyrule fall into the[Waitkey][Scroll]priest's clutches.[Scroll]If he releases the seal of the[Scroll]seven sages, evil power will[Waitkey][Scroll]overwhelm this land.[Scroll]Before that happens...[Scroll]before it's too late... destroy[Waitkey][Scroll]the priest before he destroys[Scroll]all of Hyrule!  You can do it![Scroll]You can...
[Name], be careful out there![2]I know you can save Hyrule!
[Window 02][Speed 03]Help me...[Wait 01][3]Please help me...[Waitkey][Scroll]I am a prisoner in the dungeon[Scroll]of the castle.[Scroll]My name is Zelda.[Waitkey][Scroll]The priest, Agahnim, has done...[Scroll]something to the other missing[Scroll]girls.  Now only I remain...[Waitkey][Scroll]Agahnim has seized control of[Scroll]the castle and is now trying to[Scroll]open the seven sages' seal.[Waitkey][Scroll]...   ...[Scroll]I am in the dungeon of the[Scroll]castle.[Waitkey][Scroll]Please help me...
[Window 02][Speed 03]Help me...[2]I am in the dungeon of the[3]castle.[Waitkey][Scroll]I know there is a hidden path[Scroll]from outside of the castle to[Scroll]the garden inside.
There is a secret passage in[2]the throne room that leads[3]to the Sanctuary.[Waitkey][Scroll]I'm sure the old man there[Scroll]will help us.
That ornamental shelf should[2]open.  Do you have a light?[3]It's pitch dark inside and you[Waitkey][Scroll]can't see without one.[Scroll]If you're ready, let's go![Scroll]Help me push it from the left!
You have to pull the lever to[2]open the door.  (Press the [A][3]Button and hold Down on the[Waitkey][Scroll]Control Pad. )
All right,  let's get out of here[2]before the priest notices.  I[3]know a secret path, but first[Waitkey][Scroll]we have to go to the[Scroll]first floor.  Let's go!
[Name], listen carefully.  The[2]priest is magically controlling[3]all the soldiers in the castle.[Waitkey][Scroll]I fear the worst for[Scroll]my father...[Scroll]The priest is an inhuman fiend[Waitkey][Scroll]with strong magical powers![Scroll]...   ...   ...[Waitkey][Scroll]Do you understand?[Scroll]    > Yes[Scroll]       Not at all[Choose]
You should follow the marks[2]the elder made on your map[3]when you explore.[Waitkey][Scroll]If you don't know what to do[Scroll]next, you can also visit a[Scroll]fortune teller.
[Name], you are wonderful![2]As I thought, you have the[3]power of the Hero inside you![Waitkey][Scroll]Now, you should get the Master[Scroll]Sword.  I am confident that you[Scroll]can defeat the evil priest!
[Window 02][Speed 03][Name]!  Help!  The soldiers[2]are coming to the Sanctuary![3]AIEEEEEEE![Waitkey][Scroll]... ... ...
After passing through these[2]sewers, we will be very close[3]to the Sanctuary![Waitkey][Scroll]Let's be careful!
The Sanctuary is just beyond[2]that door.  Pull the switch[3]over there.
Who? Oh, it's you, [Name]![2]What can I do for you, young[3]man?  The elder?  Oh, no one[Waitkey][Scroll]has seen him since the priest[Scroll]began collecting victims...[Scroll]...   ...   ...[Waitkey][Scroll]What?  Master Sword?  Well, I[Scroll]don't remember the details[Scroll]exactly, but...
Long ago, a prosperous people[2]known as the Hylians inhabited[3]this land...[Waitkey][Scroll]Legends tell of many treasures[Scroll]that the Hylians hid throughout[Scroll]the land...[Waitkey][Scroll]The Master Sword, a mighty[Scroll]blade forged against those[Scroll]with evil hearts, is one of[Waitkey][Scroll]them.  People say that now it[Scroll]is sleeping deep in the forest...[Scroll]... ... ...[Waitkey][Scroll]Do you understand the legend?[Scroll]    > Yes[Scroll]       Not at all[Choose]
Anyway, look for the elder.[2]There must be someone in the[3]village who knows where he is.[Waitkey][Scroll]You take care now, [Name][...]
Ohhh,[Name].  You've changed![2]You look marvelous...  Please[3]save us from Agahnim[Waitkey][Scroll]the priest!
Hey!  Here is [Name], the[2]wanted man!  Soldiers!  Anyone![3]Come quickly!
Incredible!  At last you have[2]the three Pendants[...]  Now, you[3]should go to the Lost Woods.[Waitkey][Scroll]If you are the true Hero, the[Scroll]sword itself will select you.[Scroll][...] [...] [...]
I am too old to fight.[2]I can only rely on you.
I am, indeed, Sahasrahla, the[2]village elder and a descendent[3]of the seven sages.[Waitkey][Scroll]...   ...     Oh really?[Scroll][Name], I am surprised a young[Scroll]man like you is searching for[Waitkey][Scroll]the sword of evil's bane.[Scroll]Not just anyone can use that[Scroll]weapon.  Legends say only the[Waitkey][Scroll]Hero who has won the three[Scroll]Pendants can wield the sword.[Scroll]...   ...   ...[Waitkey][Scroll]Do you really want to find it?[Scroll]    > Yeah![Scroll]       Of Course![Choose]
Good.  As a test, can you[2]retrieve the Pendant Of[3]Courage from the East Palace?[Waitkey][Scroll]If you bring it here, I will tell[Scroll]you more of the legend and[Scroll]give you a magical artifact.[Sound 2D][Waitkey][Scroll]Now, go forward to the palace.
Other relatives of the sages[2]are hiding from the evil[3]priest's followers.[Waitkey][Scroll]You should find them.
[Window 02][Speed 03][Name], it is I, Sahasrahla.[2]I am communicating to you[3]across the void through[Waitkey][Scroll]telepathy...  The place where[Scroll]you now stand was the Sacred[Scroll]Realm, but evil power turned it[Waitkey][Scroll]into the Dark World.  The[Scroll]priest has broken the sages'[Scroll]seal and opened a gate[Waitkey][Scroll]to link the worlds[Scroll]at Hyrule Castle.  In[Scroll]order to save this half of the[Waitkey][Scroll]world, the Light World, you[Scroll]must win back the Golden[Scroll]Power.  You must also rescue[Waitkey][Scroll]the seven maidens who Agahnim[Scroll]sent to the Dark World.  As[Scroll]members of the bloodline of[Waitkey][Scroll]the seven sages, they have[Scroll]power that will surely help you.[Scroll]The maidens are locked in[Waitkey][Scroll]hidden dungeons full of evil[Scroll]creatures and dangerous traps.[Scroll]The Dark Palace should[Waitkey][Scroll]be your first goal in this world![Sound 2D][Scroll][Name], I can rely on only[Scroll]you.  Please make this old[Waitkey][Scroll]man's wishes come true.[Scroll]I beg you!
[Window 02][Speed 03]But I sense your helplessness[...][2]Before you go any further,[3]find the Moon Pearl on[Waitkey][Scroll]Death Mountain.  It will protect[Scroll]you from the Dark World's[Scroll]magic so you can keep your[Waitkey][Scroll]heroic figure.
A helpful item is hidden in the[2]cave on the east side of Lake[3]Hylia.  Get it!
Oh!?  You got the Pendant Of[2]Courage!  Now I will tell you[3]more of the legend...[Waitkey][Scroll]Three or four generations ago,[Scroll]an order of knights protected[Scroll]the Hylian royalty.[Waitkey][Scroll]These Knights Of Hyrule were[Scroll]also guardians of the Pendant[Scroll]Of Courage.[Waitkey][Scroll]Unfortunately, most of them[Scroll]were destroyed in the great[Scroll]war against evil that took[Waitkey][Scroll]place when the seven sages[Scroll]created their seal.  Among the[Scroll]descendants of the Knights Of[Waitkey][Scroll]Hyrule a hero must appear.[Scroll]...I see.  [Name], I believe you.[Scroll]You should get the remaining[Waitkey][Scroll]Pendants.[Scroll]And carry this with you.[Scroll]This is a treasure passed down[Waitkey][Scroll]by the families of the sages.[Scroll]I want you to have it.
You are correct, young man![2]I am Sahasrahla, the village[3]elder and a descendent of the[Waitkey][Scroll]seven sages.[Scroll]... ... ... What?[Scroll][Name], I'm surprised a young[Waitkey][Scroll]man like you is looking for the[Scroll]sword of evil's bane.  Not just[Scroll]anyone can use that sword.[Waitkey][Scroll]According to the tales handed[Scroll]down by the Hylians, only the[Scroll]Hero who has destroyed three[Waitkey][Scroll]great evils and won the three[Scroll]Pendants can wield the sword...[Scroll]... ... ...[Waitkey][Scroll]I see you have acquired the[Scroll]Pendant of Courage.  I will tell[Scroll]you about the legend behind it.[Waitkey][Scroll]Three or four generations ago,[Scroll]an order of knights protected[Scroll]the Hylian royalty.[Waitkey][Scroll]These Knights Of Hyrule were[Scroll]also guardians of the Pendant[Scroll]Of Courage.[Waitkey][Scroll]Unfortunately, most of them[Scroll]were destroyed in the great[Scroll]war against evil that took[Waitkey][Scroll]place when the seven sages[Scroll]created their seal.

I don't know who you are, but[2]if you are going to go up[3]the mountain, will you take me[Waitkey][Scroll]with you?  I lost my lamp,[Scroll]so[...]
The missing maidens are still[2]alive somewhere.

The priest has deceived the[2]King, and now he is trying to[3]open the way to the[Waitkey][Scroll]Dark World.  To complete[Scroll]your quest, you will need[Scroll]the Moon Pearl, which is in the[Waitkey][Scroll]tower on top of the mountain.[Scroll]All I can do for you now is to[Scroll]comfort your weariness...[Waitkey][Scroll]Come back here any time.

You didn't change your shape?[2]You aren't just a normal guy,[3]are you?
What do you want?![2]Do you have something to say[3]to me, silly rabbit?![Waitkey][Scroll]I came here to get the Golden[Scroll]Power but now I'm a freak and[Scroll]I can't go back to the real[Waitkey][Scroll]world!
