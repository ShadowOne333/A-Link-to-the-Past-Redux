Since the shovel isn't replaced anymore by the flute it is possible to dig it up multiple times.
To prevent this, apply the flute_fix.ips

If you plan to make acquire the flute out of a chest, there's no need to apply this patch.
In this case you may set a tree or something else not dig-able on the native flute location.
