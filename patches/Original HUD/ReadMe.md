# ORIGINAL HUD PATCHES

-------------------

This folder includes patches that have all of the current Redux features, but with the Original HUD being present, instead of the new HUD found in the main Redux hack. There's some key points to cover for these patches:

	1) ONLY apply either main Redux OR one of the Original HUD patches over your base ROM, NEVER both together.
	3) NEVER patch main Redux with one of these patches, or there will have graphical glitches!
	2) DON'T combine any of the patches inside this folder, use only one of the available 8 patches inside this folder.

-------------------

Once you have patched your vanilla ROM with one of the available 8 patches (depending on user's preference), you can then use SOME of the optional patches for main Redux, but not all of them.

Here's the Optional patches compatible with Original HUD:

	* Disable Dash Turning
	* Enable FMV for MSU-1
	* Max Bomb-Arrows Amounts
	* Mirror Works in Both Worlds
	* Move Blocks Indefinitely
	* Original Bomb-Arrow Amounts
	* Original Pink Hair Link
	* Remove Low Health Beep
	* Start at Full Hearts

The optional patches that constitute graphical changes, like the Green Agahnim, Triforce of the Gods Subtitles and Green Agahnim+Subtitle optional patches are ONLY for main Redux. Original HUD has its patches for these inside the "Original HUD" folder, and only one of them should be used.

Don't mix them up!
